### About

Basically one day I was searching for domains on namecheap and found out that the new TLD '.pizza' was available. After some playing around with the domain search I stumbled across [goto.pizza](http://goto.pizza) and the idea was born. I treated the site with the same design philosophy as most of the classic unix tools: do one thing but do it well. The site literally does one thing and one thing only: shows you pizza places around you, and the pertinent information required to obtain pizza from them (address, rating, phone number).

### Special Thanks

Just want to give a shout out to my contributor [WordsPerMinute](https://github.com/WordsPerMinute) for his work on the markers and for the ultra dope pizza icon. Thanks dude!
